What you will need to create this amazing pizza - 

Veggie Pizza Toppings
This pizza starts with a base of my whole wheat pizza dough. As an alternative, use one pound of store-bought pizza dough, which you can divide by two to follow my recipe exactly (or just make one large pizza—that also works with store-bought dough).

Then we’ll add the following. This recipe is truly very flexible — you can skip any of them if you don’t like them or don’t have them. Use more of one for less of another. Easy!


-Pizza Sauce

-Baby Spinach

-Part-Skim Mozzarella

-Artichoke

-Bell Pepper

-Red Onion

-Cherry Tomatoes

-Olives

-Optional Garnishes
